robo-scribus
============

A python-based interface to drive Scribus scripts to drive automated document processing. Long-ish documents with repetitive data processing tasks, like a photo album, for instance, can be processed in a more automated manner by tying Scribus to utilities like ImageMagick for image processing and other data processes and then automatically inserting them in to the target document.

This code has been used for several photo album productions. Each time refinements have been made. Please feel free to fork it and make your own improvements. For starters, some dialogs could be added to eliminate editing the control file.
